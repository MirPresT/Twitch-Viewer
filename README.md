### Project Description
This project was designed to allow users to quickly see if certain twitch channels were online. Some additional information is display ie) followers, status, viewers etc.

This project was inspired by freeCodeCamp.com's twitch project / challenge. It was suggested that this be built in codepen but I felt github pages would be much better suited for a project of this size.
